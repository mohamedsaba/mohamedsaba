## Projects

### [isIdempotent](https://github.com/mohamedsaba/isIdempotent)
Distributed idempotency protection library for NestJS to prevent double-spend and retry-storm anomalies in distributed transactions. Implements atomic distributed locking via Redis and custom Lua scripts, coupled with deep-sorted SHA-256 request fingerprinting to eliminate key collisions. Features a resilient O(1) memory store with lazy expiration and status-aware caching for production-grade scale.

### [Distributed Rate Limiter as a Service](https://github.com/mohamedsaba/RateLimiterSDK)
Multi-tenant rate limiting microservice with REST API and npm SDK. Implemented three algorithms — fixed window, sliding window log, and sliding window counter — using Redis sorted sets and atomic Lua scripts to eliminate race conditions under concurrent load. Supports 2,000+ req/sec at sub-5ms p99.

### [Webhook Delivery Engine](https://github.com/mohamedsaba/webhook-engine)
Webhook delivery service guaranteeing at-least-once event delivery with exponential backoff retries, HMAC-SHA256 payload signing, and idempotency key deduplication. API and worker run as separate scalable services. Includes a real-time delivery log dashboard via SSE.

### [League of Legends Competitive Analytics Engine](https://github.com/mohamedsaba/TRUSIGHT)
Full-stack competitive gaming analytics and matchmaking system. MMR calculation engine using KNN algorithm, player performance tracking, Redis caching layer, and Riot Games API integration. Built as a pnpm monorepo with a shared mmr-engine package.
